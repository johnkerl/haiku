Trees yet twigged and skeletal
Squint to see bud tips

forgive
Rat-a-tat-a-tat
Door slams; woodpecker pauses
Rat-a-tat-a-tat

accept
Leaves curled, they need
water -- gratefully they yield
joyful petrichor

laugh
Little icy brook
tumbles laughing over old
dead fallen branches

insist
Green tendrils wending,
like fingers prying barred doors,
up through crumbling brick

remember
Grandfather's keys, coins,
knife, life gone -- leaving only
scratches on old desk

whisper
Late, silent attic
Leafing idly through yearbooks
Memories whisper

educate
Mom and Dad fighting
He won, she lost; he smiled smug
Decades she waited

model
Airplane window seat --
all simple below -- one of
my favorite places
