<p>These are haiku/senryu I&rsquo;ve published on Threads. Each is preceded by the day&rsquo;s single-word prompt by <code>@haikufeels</code>.

<br>another sits smug

<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">permit</span>
<br>Saturday morning &mdash;
<br>no to-do list, no guilts tripped &mdash;
<br>consciousness can wait

<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">pay</span>
<br>One more drink can&rsquo;t hurt &mdash; ?
<br>Except at my age, oh yes,
<br>by morning it will

<br>Fifty years they had &mdash;
<br>good ones, both said &mdash; reminders
<br>of the possible

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">discount</span>
<br>Discounting the risks,
<br>our friend chicken crossed the road
<br>for reasons untold

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">rest</span>
<br>Turtle on day off,
<br>northbound geese coasting mid-flight &mdash;
<br>rest is relative

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">prank (April 1 2024)</span>
<br>There once was a poet named Anne
<br>who cooked up an internet plan
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to inspire haiku
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;in the hearts of all you
<br>but Fools&rsquo; Day is now here at hand

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">elope</span>
<br>Paper and scissors
<br>have finally worked it out &mdash;
<br>poor rock, all alone

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">lie</span>
<br>On riverbed floor
<br>lies a stone cast in anger
<br>eight hundred years ago

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">scam</span>
<br>Palaces and yachts;
<br>hovels, starvation; all on
<br>an abundant earth

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">dream</span>
<br>As cats chase mouse toys,
<br>humans chase dream homes, cars, wealth &mdash;
<br>ever compulsion

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">rinse</span>
<br>After desert rain,
<br>once-dusty streets now glisten
<br>momentarily

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">drive</span>
<br>High up and southward
<br>geese beat their wings, veeing heads-
<br>first into cold rain

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">lift</span>
<br>Spring pollen arrives &mdash;
<br>much aloft &mdash; and to my nose &mdash;
<br>another tissue

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">embark</span>
<br>Drop of melting ice
<br>quivers on hillside tree branch:
<br>ocean, here I come

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">guess</span>
<br>Wondering if this
<br>will go well &mdash; already your
<br>jaw sets &mdash; I guess not

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">want</span>
<br>For want of a nail
<br>the shoe was lost &mdash; alas, poor
<br>tilty three-shoed horse

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">have</span>
<br>Of all the moments
<br>that ever were, only one,
<br>only now, is ours

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">nod</span>
<br>Flowers nod in breeze
<br>&mdash; clich&eacute;, I know &mdash; sorry, folks &mdash;
<br>a long day at work

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">wash</span>
<br>Arroyo, wadi,
<br>wash: shaped like a river, but
<br>dry almost always

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">sacrifice</span>
<br>Green leaves without rain
<br>All droop; seven green, three brown
<br>How are they chosen?

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">drizzle</span>
<br>Drizzle all morning
<br>No punctuation &mdash; and then
<br>a crack of thunder

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">soak</span>
<br>Five days of rain now
<br>and still counting &mdash; rivulets
<br>wending riverward

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">snag</span>
<br>Just one more thing, sir &mdash;
<br>before you board the airplane &mdash;
<br>have you your passport?

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">tidal</span>
<br>Locked eternally
<br>facing Earth&rsquo;s aches &mdash; does the moon
<br>wish for innocence?

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">drift</span>
<br>Sit, said Master Thay,
<br>like a pebble drifting down
<br>to rest in water

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">tumble</span>
<br>Twisting river, roar
<br>approaching, fall of water,
<br>down to stones below

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">hike</span>
<br>We climbed that mountain
<br>Above the clouds, fog all around &mdash;
<br>a different heaven

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">accident</span>
<br>It was a third date &mdash;
<br>Mom and Dad had barely met &mdash;
<br>and now here I am

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">lullaby</span>
<br>Gentle roof murmurs
<br>Open-window petrichor
<br>Night rain soothes the soul

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">bend</span>
<br>Breeze bends through curtains
<br>as light as memory, heavy
<br>as wistful regret

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">vacant</span>
<br>Uncircled peace signs
<br>end abruptly in mid-beach &mdash;
<br>shorebird has flown away

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">river</span>
<br>Long runs and rushes &mdash;
<br>the ancient seaward river
<br>folds, turns, flows through time

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">fickle</span>
<br>The weather, and cats &mdash;
<br>what else is fickle? My own
<br>creativity

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">cake</span>
<br>Baby elephant
<br>caked with mud, small and forlorn &mdash;
<br>Mom&rsquo;s nasal shower

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">meditate</span>
<br>Still air, pond, hot sun
<br>Dragonfly alights on stem &mdash;
<br>waits, and longer waits

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">assemble</span>
<br>Sidewalk scattering &mdash;
<br>O Pigeon Optimism! &mdash;
<br>there aren&rsquo;t enough seeds

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">pick</span>
<br>Seagull drops a clam
<br>to the stony shore below &mdash;
<br>dines on the halfshell

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">cut</span>
<br>Orchard branches pruned &mdash;
<br>in with good, out with bad &mdash; but
<br>who wields the knife?

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">need</span>
<br>Becalmed in mid-sea,
<br>three side-eyeing sailors wait
<br>for a hint of breeze

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">weave</span>
<br>Final breath &mdash; she let
<br>loose strands of life she had so
<br>carefully woven

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">question</span>
<br>Grey clouds hang shaggy
<br>Like sheep&rsquo;s untended belly wool
<br>Hints of maybe rain

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">design</span>
<br>Brand-new spider web
<br>Bead of water glints in sun
<br>No insects fooled yet

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">paddle</span>
<br>Mallard pair: brown, green
<br>On water, silence &mdash; before
<br>and after rainfall

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">see</span>
<br>Always five stars: six,
<br>one night &mdash; what solar system&rsquo;s
<br>birth or death unfolds?

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">exclude</span>
<br>Old man and the sea
<br>spoiler alert: fish get caught
<br>No white whale, no sale

<span class="boldmaroon">request</span>
<br>Mrs. Dalloway
<br>plot summary: rejection
<br>comes back to party

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">debate</span>
<br>Treeful of swallows;
<br>another dawn; cacophony
<br>ensues, and then flight

<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">describe</span>
<br>Bare, waving branches
<br>describe hopes for the future
<br>upon a grey sky

<br>Two tentative buds
<br>feeling sun, loosening bonds,

<br>I water my plants
<br>almost as much as I should
<br>green leaves, one yellow

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">clean</span>
<br>Dishwasher is full
<br>and run. My conscience is clean.
<br>And who needs cupboards.

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">vibrate</span>
<br>Aspen leaves in fall
<br>A million quivering glints
<br>Hillside ashimmer

<p><hr>

<span class="boldmaroon">fire</span>
<br>Cold ash: job well done
<br>Unburnt wood lumps: you refused
<br>to help out last night

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">subdue</span>
<br>People are coming
<br>and going, all the day long
<br>Cat squints; tail twitch

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">play</span>
<br>Hot day in summer
<br>People seek shade and water
<br>Petals sway in breeze

<p><hr>

<br>Century-old home
<br>Now grey and splintered timbers
<br>Sunlight peeks between

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">reply</span>
<br>Deep cavern, darkness
<br>Water, no sun, no algae
<br>One plink, one echo

<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">sketch</span>
<br>Horizontal sunset
<br>Green tree, black shadow on wall
<br>Two trees side by side

<br>Bird chatter fills trees
<br>One certain distant trill &mdash; one
<br>wide-eyed bird aroused

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">stab</span>
<br>Cringing to think of
<br>an ineptitude of mine
<br>thirty years ago

<span class="boldmaroon">protest</span>
<br>Two cat dishes placed
<br>One whiskered head bows to eat
<br>One raised tail departs

<span class="boldmaroon">cook</span>
<br>Desert sun&rsquo;s hammer blows
<br>left me reeling, out of state
<br>seeking shade eastward

<br>Past root, bole, and fen,
<br>the many-voiced river wends
<br>murmuring seaward

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">confused</span>
<br>Eyes closed in the woods
<br>Leaf, bird, bug, deer, snake, mouse sounds
<br>A confusion of lives

<p><hr>
<p>
<span class="boldmaroon">retreat</span>
<br>Mouse tiptoes outward
<br>Owl flies low; moon silhouette
<br>A hungry retreat

<br>Winter&rsquo;s first snowfall
<br>Asphalt creations shrouded
<br>Silence surrounding

<br>ancient and ever higher
<br>until the world changes

<br>sparkles, drips, not yet fallen &mdash;
<br>sword of Damocles

<br>under winter soil

<br>Rat-a-tat-a-tat

<br>Little icy brook
<br>tumbles laughing over old
<br>dead fallen branches
