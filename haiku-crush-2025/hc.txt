Drizzle all morning,
no punctuation -- and then --
a crack of thunder

The heart of the dead
in left pan, feather in right:
a god’s scale weighs

Through summer’s torpor
souls languish, linger, rally,
saved by quiet rain

Four billion years old --
bruised, pockmarked, pummeled, cratered --
still a whole moon

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sea fingers recede
from shore, sand hisses, moon glints,
tide builds its return

----------------------------------------------------------------

A glacial cleft,
a gouge in the horizon --
young iceberg is free

Green tendrils wending,
like fingers prying barred doors,
up through crumbling brick

Mouse tiptoes outward
Owl flies low; moon silhouette
A hungry retreat

Cry echoes in canyon
Hawk soars, eyes search left and right
A pair bond’s ending

Subway-tunnel halt
One hundred lives together
No one says a word

On riverbed floor
lies a stone cast in anger
eight hundred years ago
