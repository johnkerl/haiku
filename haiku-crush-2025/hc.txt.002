Through summer’s torpor
souls languish, linger, rally,
saved by quiet rain

The heart of the dead
in left pan, feather in right:
a god’s scale weighs

Behold the heron:
knee-deep in muck and mire,
it jumps, flaps, glides free

Cry echoes in canyon
Hawk soars, eyes search left and right
A pair bond’s ending


Sea fingers recede
from shore, sand hisses, moon glints --
tide builds its return

Moon plunges into
earth’s bloody shadow -- crosses --
emerges clean, bright

A glacial cleft,
a gouge in the horizon --
young iceberg is free

A seaside sunset --
waves roll forth, then whisper back
on into dark night

----------------------------------------------------------------

Subway-tunnel halt
One hundred lives together
No one says a word

Summer deluge ends --
gutter’s rain drips on earth -- wind
leaves with one last sigh

Mountain ridges fold
west, lighter and lighter blue,
fading into mist

May we dwell on earth
til mountains move and canyons carve,
etched in history

Midge on pond water,
free, fearless -- alas for fish,
there’s a string attached

Four billion years old --
bruised, pockmarked, pummeled, cratered --
still a whole moon

On riverbed floor
lies a stone cast in anger
eight hundred years ago

Drizzle all morning,
no punctuation -- and then
a crack of thunder

Uncircled peace signs
end abruptly in mid-beach --
shorebird has flown away

Mouse tiptoes outward
Owl flies low; moon silhouette
A hungry retreat

Snowflakes add, glacier
ancient and ever higher
until the world changes

Green tendrils wending,
like fingers prying barred doors,
up through crumbling brick

----------------------------------------------------------------

While the mean measures
normalcy, lose not hope in
the deviation

No longer sheltered
by parents’ umbrella, she
raises her own now

Canoe pushes off --
workday worries drift away,
equally unmoored

Today’s roof leak --
nature’s probing fingers seek
future time’s ruins

With a nudge of oar
one is afloat on water,
unmoored from worry

Silent resentments,
simmering hot and red like
a sauce, bubbling

Under the kayak
swim fish unseen -- tending to
errands of their own

Five days of rain now
and still counting -- rivulets
wending riverward

Bare, waving branches
describe hopes for the future
upon a grey sky

Past root, bole, and fen,
the many-voiced river wends
murmuring seaward

To rehearse the lies
one tells oneself, and keep them,
can be a life’s work
