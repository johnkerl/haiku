mire
Behold the heron:
knee-deep in muck and mire,
it jumps, flaps, glides free

rally
Through summer’s torpor
souls languish, linger, rally,
saved by quiet rain

balance
The heart of the dead
in left pan, feather in right:
a god’s scale weighs	

rehearse
To rehearse the lies
one tells oneself, and keep them,
can be a life’s work	

sigh
Summer deluge ends—
gutter’s rain drips on earth—wind
leaves with one last sigh	

cry
Cry echoes in canyon
Hawk soars, eyes search left and right
A pair bond’s ending


fold
Mountain ridges fold
west, lighter and lighter blue,
fading into mist	

mix
Subway-tunnel halt
One hundred lives together
No one says a word	

May we dwell on earth
til mountains move and canyons carve,
etched in history	

Sea fingers recede
from shore, sand hisses, moon glints—
tide builds its return	

While the mean measures
normalcy, lose not hope in
the deviation	

Moon plunges into
earth’s bloody shadow—crosses—
emerges clean, bright	

No longer sheltered
by parents’ umbrella, she
raises her own now	

Canoe pushes off—
workday worries drift away,
equally unmoored	

A glacial cleft,
a gouge in the horizon—
young iceberg is free	

Midge on pond water,
free, fearless—alas for fish,
there’s a string attached	

Today’s roof leak—
nature’s probing fingers seek
future time’s ruins

A lakeside sunset—
waves roll forth, then whisper back
on into dark night	

With a nudge of oar
one is afloat on water,
unmoored from worry


Four billion years old—
bruised, pockmarked, pummeled, cratered—
still a whole moon


Silent resentments,
simmering hot and red like
a sauce, bubbling	

Under the kayak
swim fish unseen—tending to
errands of their own

lie
On riverbed floor
lies a stone cast in anger
eight hundred years ago	

Drizzle all morning
No punctuation—and then
a crack of thunder	

Five days of rain now
and still counting—rivulets
wending riverward


Uncircled peace signs
end abruptly in mid-beach—
shorebird has flown away

Bare, waving branches
describe hopes for the future
upon a grey sky	

Past root, bole, and fen,
the many-voiced river wends
murmuring seaward	

Mouse tiptoes outward
Owl flies low; moon silhouette
A hungry retreat	

Snowflakes add, glacier
ancient and ever higher
until the world changes	

Green tendrils wending,
like fingers prying barred doors,
up through crumbling brick
